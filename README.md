# Pneumonia Detection via CNNs and Ensemble Learning
BTP Semester 7, NSUT. Project-I.
***

This is a repository for all code for the course Project of Semester-7 of group 50 of the NSUT batch of '24. This code is written by Stubh Lal (2020UIT3116), Manik (2020UUIT3124) and Sippu Utkarsh (2020UITT3137).

This project aims to diagnose the presence of Pneumonia in chest X-Rays via the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), combining the knowledge and patterns learnt by multiple CNNs using an ensemble for classification.
